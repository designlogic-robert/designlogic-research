# USR — Universal Semantic Runtime

The Universal Semantic Runtime defines how meaning *flows* through a system.  
It is the execution substrate that orchestrates semantic operations, maintains global invariants, and coordinates multi-layer reasoning.

## Contents

- Runtime theory  
- Global semantic invariants  
- Cross-domain runtime rules  
- Deterministic orchestration (ORCH-C compatible)  
- Integration with UST  
- Safety constraints  
- Influence/consent policies (CAP)  
- Alignment Theory foundation

## Purpose

USR is the “semantic operating system” for all USS architectures.  
It ensures that every engine, token, and domain stack behaves consistently under a unified runtime model.

USR is to semantics what the TCP/IP stack is to networking.
