# UST — Universal Semantic Token Model

The Universal Semantic Token Model defines how meaning is represented, typed, routed, and transformed across all USS systems.

## Contents

- **Semantic Tokens**  
  Foundation token set for AI industry applications.

- **TeleoTokens**  
  Token system for gaming, narrative, teleogenic, and agency modeling.

- **TradeTokens**  
  Token family optimized for market prediction, temporal signals, and financial dynamics.

- **Domain Tokens**  
  Additional token families for future domains (medical, legal, robotics, etc.)

## Purpose

UST provides a universal, stable representation layer.  
All Cognitive Engines (SynCE, QLE, FinCE) and all semantic engines depend on UST for structured meaning.

UST ensures:
- deterministic meaning formation  
- cross-domain compatibility  
- machine-interpretable semantic features  
- consistent invariants
