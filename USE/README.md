# USE — Universal Semantic Engine

The Universal Semantic Engine is the execution engine that turns semantic intent into structured plans and actions.

It sits directly beneath Cognitive Engines and above the Universal Semantic Runtime.

## Contents

- Engine lifecycle design  
- Execution graph model  
- Routing and dispatch logic  
- Constraint systems  
- Safety/ethics layers  
- Semantic reduction and expansion logic  
- Multi-engine integration patterns

## Purpose

USE is the “semantic processor” of USS.  
Where USR defines the rules and invariants, USE performs the actual work.

Cognitive Engines sit on USE to produce domain-specific functionality.
