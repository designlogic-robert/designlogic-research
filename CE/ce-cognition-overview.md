# Cognition Engine Overview (CE)

The Cognition Engine (CE) is the cognitive execution layer of the Universal Semantic System (USS).  
It converts semantic structures generated by USR and interpreted by USE into stable, inspectable reasoning.

## 1. Position in the USS Stack

CE sits after the semantic executor (USE) and before any domain engines:
```
UST (tokens)
↓
USR (routing)
↓
USE (execution)
↓
CE (cognition)
↓
Domain Engines (SynCE, FinCE, QLE)
↓
Output
```

Each layer constrains and structures the next.  
CE receives deterministic semantic sequences from USE and turns them into cognitive actions.

## 2. What CE Does

CE provides the machinery that transforms semantic flow into reasoning.  
It does this by applying a structured six-stage cycle:

### 1. Orient  
Establish grounding, context, and semantic boundaries.  
Determine what problem is actually being solved.

### 2. Evaluate  
Analyze constraints, risk factors, semantic weight, and relevance of the UST structures.

### 3. Model  
Construct internal models: causal frames, hypothesis structures, prediction graphs, or reasoning scaffolds.

### 4. Select  
Choose the appropriate cognitive strategy or reasoning path (analytic, comparative, abductive, etc.).

### 5. Justify  
Generate transparent reasoning traces.  
This is the CE layer’s core contribution: *why* the reasoning path is valid.

### 6. Finalize  
Produce a deterministic reasoning unit that downstream domain engines can extend with domain knowledge.

## 3. Cognitive Postures

CE does not operate in a single mode.  
It adapts via **cognitive postures**—metastable configurations that guide emphasis in the reasoning process.

Examples:

- **Analytic posture** — precision, constraint checking, formal traceability  
- **Exploratory posture** — hypothesis generation and alternative framing  
- **Pragmatic posture** — efficient path selection under practical constraints  
- **Reflective posture** — justification and transparency emphasis

These postures are further detailed in `ce-cognitive-postures.md`.

## 4. Deterministic Guarantees

CE inherits deterministic sequencing from USR and USE.  
Within that scaffold, CE guarantees:

- reproducible cognitive paths  
- stable module behavior  
- invariant-checked reasoning structures  
- explicit justification rather than hidden model activations  

This converts reasoning from an opaque LLM process into a structured cognitive pipeline.

## 5. Output: The Reasoning Unit

The final product of CE is a **Reasoning Unit (RU)**.  
An RU is a structured object containing:

- selected cognitive path  
- reasoning trace  
- semantic references  
- justification  
- boundary conditions  
- confidence and constraints  

Domain engines extend RUs with domain-specific knowledge to produce final answers.

## 6. CE in the Larger Architecture

CE is the bridge between semantics and expertise.  
It separates “meaning” from “reasoning” and enables:

- plug-and-play domain engines  
- fully inspectable reasoning  
- deterministic cognitive operations  
- modular growth of the USS ecosystem

CE is the layer that lets USS scale from semantic structure → actionable intelligence.
