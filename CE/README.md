# CE — Cognitive Engines

Cognitive Engines (CEs) are domain-specialized engines built on top of USE + UST + USR.

## Included Engines

### SynCE  
Semantic Engine for AI systems, agents, and synthetic cognition.

### QLE  
Quest Line Engine — narrative, gaming, teleogenic choice modeling, and dynamic world systems.

### FinCE  
Financial Cognitive Engine — prediction scaffolding, temporal market semantics, trade pattern modeling, and agent-based simulations.

### Future Engines  
Medical, legal, robotics, education, and other domain-specific CEs will be added as research expands.

## Purpose

Cognitive Engines turn foundational semantic infrastructure (USR, UST, USE) into real-world systems.  
They provide application power while preserving the deterministic, invariant-driven design of USS.
